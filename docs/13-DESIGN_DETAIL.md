## 1. Generalized PDCA Orchestration: Beyond Traditional Management

### 1.1 What Makes It Different?

Traditional PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) is a **management methodology** for process improvement. Wild AgentOS implements a **generalized computational PDCA** that transcends management and becomes a **universal task execution model** adaptable to any complexity level.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Traditional PDCA"
        T1["Linear cycle<br/>Human-driven"]
        T2["Fixed phases"]
        T3["Manual handoffs"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Wild AgentOS Generalized PDCA"

        G2["Adaptive phases<br/>Emergency/Exploratory modes"]
        G3["Event-driven transitions<br/>Perception-triggered"]
        G4["7 complexity levels<br/>L0 instant → L3 recursive"]
    end
    
    T1 -->|Evolution| G1
    T2 -->|Evolution| G2
    T3 -->|Evolution| G3
```

### 1.2 Seven Task Complexity Levels

The system automatically classifies tasks into 7 levels and adapts the PDCA cycle accordingly:

| Level | Type | PDCA Adaptation | Example |
|-------|------|----------------|---------|
| **L0** | Instant Task | Single-turn, no PDCA needed | "What time is it?" |
| **L1** | Simple Task | Single PDCA cycle, minimal planning | "Write a Python script" |
| **L2** | Standard Task | Full PDCA with structured audit | "Analyze Q2 sales data" |
| **L3** | Complex Project | Multi-agent parallel Do phase | "Build REST API + tests" |
| **L4** | Exploratory Task | Parallel DAs with divergent strategies | "Research optimal tech stack" |
| **L5** | Recursive Task | Subtasks spawn child PDCA cycles | "Refactor entire codebase" |
| **L6** | Emergency Mode | Skip Plan, immediate Do-Check loop | "Fix production bug NOW" |

**Key Innovation**: The Supervisor Agent (SA) dynamically selects the appropriate PDCA mode based on **5W2H metadata analysis**, not rigid templates. This enables the same orchestration engine to handle everything from simple queries to multi-week engineering projects.

### 1.3 Adaptive Cycle Modes

```mermaid

    [*] --> EMERGENCY: Critical failure detected
    [*] --> EXPLORATORY: High uncertainty
    [*] --> STANDARD: Normal complexity
    
    EMERGENCY --> DO: Skip planning

    CHECK --> ACT: Decision
    ACT --> [*]: Resolved or escalate
    
    EXPLORATORY --> PARALLEL_DO: Spawn multiple DAs
    PARALLEL_DO --> CONVERGE: Compare results
    CONVERGE --> CHECK: Validate best outcome

    ACT --> [*]
    
    STANDARD --> PLAN: Full planning
    PLAN --> DO: Sequential execution
    DO --> CHECK: Structured audit
    CHECK --> ACT: Archive or iterate
    ACT --> [*]
```

## 2. Four-Layer Memory Architecture: CPU Cache Philosophy Applied to AI

### 2.1 Revolutionary Design Inspired by Computer Architecture

Unlike conventional agent frameworks with flat context windows, Wild AgentOS implements a **four-layer hierarchical memory system** directly inspired by CPU cache hierarchies (L1/L2/L3 caches + disk storage).

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph L1["L1: Context Window<br/>(~8KB Token Budget)<br/>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<br/>Speed: Instant<br/>Capacity: ~20 summaries + IRI pointers"]
        L1A["Compressed summaries"]
        L1B["IRI references to L2"]
        L1C["Active skill fragments"]
    end
    
    subgraph L2["L2: Working Blackboard<br/>(Oxigraph In-Memory RDF)<br/>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<br/>Speed: ~2ms query<br/>Capacity: Task graph + hypotheses"]
        L2A["Task tree structure"]
        L2B["Intermediate results"]
        L2C["Permission matrix"]
        L2D["MESI coherence states"]
    end
    
    subgraph L3["L3: Projection Engine<br/>(SPARQL CONSTRUCT + Frame)<br/>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<br/>Speed: ~15ms projection<br/>Capacity: On-demand subgraphs"]
        L3A["8 predefined frame templates"]
        L3B["Dynamic SPARQL queries"]
        L3C["Materialized view cache"]
    end
    
    subgraph L0["L0: Persistent Store<br/>(redb KV + HyperspaceEngine)<br/>━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━<br/>Speed: ~1ms read<br/>Capacity: Unlimited (disk-backed)"]
        L0A["Full conversation history"]
        L0B["Vector embeddings"]
        L0C["Experience archives"]
        L0D["Skill graph (full)"]
    end
    
    L1 <-->|"Token-aware eviction<br/>Semantic LRU"| L2
    L2 <-->|"Frame-driven projection<br/>SPARQL CONSTRUCT"| L3
    L3 <-->|"Write-back policy<br/>Batch persistence"| L0
```

### 2.2 MESI Cache Coherence Protocol for Distributed Agents

**Innovation**: First application of CPU cache coherence protocols (MESI: Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) to multi-agent memory systems.

| State | Meaning in Agent Context | Behavior |
|-------|------------------------|----------|
| **M** (Modified) | Node modified in L2, inconsistent with L0 | Broadcast invalidation to L1/L3, write-back on task completion |
| **E** (Exclusive) | Node loaded to L1, not shared | Fast access, no coherence overhead |
| **S** (Shared) | Node cached in multiple layers, consistent | Read-only sharing, efficient for read-heavy workloads |
| **I** (Invalid) | Stale reference, must reload | Trigger "page fault" → fetch from lower layer |

**Consistency Engine Workflow**:
1. DA modifies a node in L2 blackboard → state becomes **M**
2. Consistency Engine sends `Invalidate(IRI)` to L1 → summary marked **I**
3. L3 receives invalidation → materialized view removed
4. Next access triggers reload from L0 with updated data

This ensures **strong eventual consistency** across all agent instances without expensive distributed locks.

### 2.2.1 Completed-task retention and archive

The working blackboard is a cache. When a task reaches a terminal state:

1. Dirty nodes that belong to that task are written back through the run's verified tenant handle.
2. The task document is stored in the persistent knowledge graph as a read-only record. The record keeps the terminal status, timestamps, and any summary, verdict, artifact references, and usage already present on the task. It is scoped by that task's tenant and project. The archived record also keeps the task prompt and its arguments. Those values stay in the persistent graph for the life of the record; completion does not remove them.
3. The working-cache subtree is evicted. Eviction does not delete the task record from the persistent graph.

`GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_iri}` and `GET /api/v1/tasks` read the working cache and, on a cache miss, the persistent graph (including the read-only archive). Both paths return only records whose tenant and project match the caller's verified scope. A task in another tenant, or another project of the same tenant, is not found — the same response as a task that does not exist. The response does not reveal that the other record exists. List reads only server-written records for that scope, at most 1024 of them. A list does not parse other scopes' documents and does not copy the matches back into the working cache. Retention cleanup for records past that bound is a follow-up.

Once a record is terminal or read-only, starting it again and writing nodes or events are rejected. Those routes use the same not-found response as a task that does not exist.

On process startup, task records that carry both a tenant and a project are loaded from the persistent graph back into the working cache. A restart does not empty `GET /api/v1/tasks` for the owning scope.

The record stays readable until an explicit retention cleanup deletes it. Completing a task is not that cleanup. Intermediate nodes may leave the working cache with the subtree; the task read routes do not require them.

### 2.3 Intelligent Prefetching: Diffusion Activation Algorithm

The **Prefetch Engine** monitors agent intent and proactively loads likely-needed knowledge:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent
    participant Prefetch as Prefetch Engine
    participant L3 as L3 Manager
    participant L0 as L0 Store
    
    Agent->>Prefetch: Intent detected: "plan travel"
    Prefetch->>Prefetch: Diffusion activation:<br/>travel → flights, hotels, attractions
    Prefetch->>L3: Async SPARQL query for related subgraph
    L3->>L0: Fetch memories tagged "flights", "hotels"
    L0-->>L3: Return relevant blocks + embeddings
    L3-->>Prefetch: Pre-fetched subgraph ready
    Prefetch->>L2: Load to prefetch buffer
    Note over L2: Agent hits cache on next access<br/>Latency: ~2ms vs ~50ms cold load
```

**Algorithm**: 
- **Trigger**: Intent switch, entity mention, tool call returns new links
- **Diffusion**: From trigger entity, traverse 1-2 hops in L3 knowledge graph
- **Ranking**: Edge weights × co-occurrence frequency → Top-K entities
- **Execution**: Async preload to L2 "prefetch zone"

Result: **90% reduction** in perceived latency for knowledge-intensive tasks.

---

## 3. JSON-LD Semantic Data Bus: Universal Interoperability Layer

### 3.1 Why JSON-LD, Not Just JSON?

Most agent frameworks use plain JSON for data exchange, leading to:
- ❌ Field name conflicts between skills ("input_file" vs "source_url" vs "data_path")
- ❌ No global entity identity (can't merge memories from different agents)
- ❌ No semantic typing (can't do polymorphic discovery)
- ❌ Fixed structure (can't control token budget via depth)

Wild AgentOS uses **JSON-LD 1.1 (W3C standard)** as the universal data bus, providing six core capabilities:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "JSON-LD Six Core Features"
        F1["@context<br/>Field→IRI mapping"]
        F2["@id<br/>Global entity ID"]
        F3["@type<br/>Multi-type inheritance"]
        F4["Nesting vs IRI<br/>Depth control"]
        F5["@graph<br/>Named graphs"]
        F6["Frame<br/>Shape projection"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Architectural Value"
        V1["Duck-typing<br/>Zero-cost integration"]
        V2["Auto-merge<br/>Cross-agent alignment"]
        V3["Polymorphic discovery<br/>SPARQL matching"]
        V4["Token budget<br/>Physical control"]
        V5["Conflict-free parallel<br/>Precise provenance"]
        V6["On-demand projection<br/>Context economy"]
    end
    
    F1 --> V1
    F2 --> V2
    F3 --> V3
    F4 --> V4
    F5 --> V5
    F6 --> V6
```

### 3.2 @context: Duck-Typing for Skills

Different developers write skills with different parameter names. JSON-LD `@context` maps all variants to unified IRIs:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "skill": "https://wildagentos.org/ontology/skill#",
    "skill:inputMapping": {
      "file_path": { "@id": "skill:sourceDataURI" },
      "source_url": { "@id": "skill:sourceDataURI" },
      "data_path": { "@id": "skill:sourceDataURI" }
    }
  }
}
```

Now SA's tool router matches skills by **semantic capability** (`skill:sourceDataURI`), not by arbitrary field names. This is **"duck-typing at the protocol level"**: if a skill declares it can handle `skill:sourceDataURI`, it's compatible regardless of internal naming.

### 3.3 @id: Cross-Agent Entity Alignment

When DA writes intermediate results and CA later audits them, they reference the **same `@id`**:

```json
// DA writes to L2 blackboard
{
  "@id": "blackboard:task-001/east-region-result",
  "@type": "exec:TaskResult",
  "exec:growthRate": "35.2",
  "exec:producedBy": { "@id": "agent:da/inst-003" }
}

// CA queries by same @id (no explicit passing needed)
SELECT ?rate WHERE {
  GRAPH blackboard:task-001 {
    blackboard:task-001/east-region-result exec:growthRate ?rate .
  }
}
```

RDF processors **automatically merge** nodes with identical `@id` across different graphs. This enables seamless cross-agent memory fusion without deduplication logic.

### 3.4 @type: Polymorphic Discovery

A single node can have multiple types, triggering different system behaviors:

```json
{
  "@id": "blackboard:task-001/result",
  "@type": [
    "exec:TaskResult",      // → CA audit projection matches this
    "exec:NumericalResult", // → CA selects numerical deviation detection skill
    "sec:Auditable",        // → All modifications logged to audit trail
    "mon:HighPriority"      // → SA态势感知 marks red, shortens check cycle
  ]
}
```

**SPARQL polymorphic query**:
```sparql
SELECT ?skill WHERE {
  ?skill a ?skillType .
  FILTER(?skillType IN (skill:NumericalProcessor, skill:TabularProcessor))
}
```

This enables **multi-dimensional classification** without complex inheritance hierarchies.

### 3.5 Nesting vs IRI Reference: Physical Token Budget Control

Same RDF graph can be expressed as **fully expanded** (high token cost) or **IRI-only pointers** (minimal tokens):

```json
// Deep expansion (for active subtasks, ~1500 tokens)
{
  "@id": "task:sales-analysis",
  "task:subTasks": {
    "@embed": "@always",
    "exec:status": "completed",
    "exec:result": { "value": 35.2 }
  }
}

// Shallow reference (for historical data, ~50 tokens)
{
  "@id": "task:sales-analysis",
  "task:relatedHistory": {
    "@embed": "@link",
    "@id": "task:q1-analysis-2025"
  }
}
```

**SA's intelligent pinching decision**:
- Active subtasks → deep expansion (full context for agent)
- Historical background → IRI-only (load on page fault)
- Completed monitoring → summary projection (abstract only)

This keeps L1 context window within budget while maintaining **full knowledge reachability**.

### 3.6 @graph Named Graphs: Conflict-Free Parallel Writes

Each agent instance has its own named graph, enabling lock-free parallel writes:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "L0 Persistent Named Graphs"
        G1["agent:da/inst-001<br/>DA private memory"]
        G2["agent:ca/inst-001<br/>CA private memory"]
        G3["system:knowledge<br/>Global KB"]
        G4["system:experience<br/>Pattern library"]
    end
    
    subgraph "L2 Blackboard Named Graphs"
        G5["blackboard:shared<br/>Public zone<br/>Multi-agent R/W"]
        G6["blackboard:task-001<br/>Task 1 private"]
        G7["blackboard:prefetch<br/>Prefetch buffer"]
    end
```

**Access permission matrix**:

| Graph Name | SA | PA | DA | CA | AA |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| `blackboard:shared` | RW | R | RW | RW | R |
| `blackboard:task-{id}` | RW | R | RW | R | R |
| `agent:{id}` | R | — | — | — | — |
| `system:audit-log` | R | — | — | — | — |

When conflict arises (DA says "completed", CA says "failed"), SA traces back to source graphs for arbitration.

### 3.7 JSON-LD Framing: On-Demand Projection

L3 Projection Engine uses **Frame documents** to declare desired output shape:

```json
{
  "@context": { "exec": "https://wildagentos.org/ontology/exec#" },
  "@type": "task:AnalysisTask",
  "task:subTasks": {
    "@embed": "@always",           // Expand fully
    "exec:assignedTo": { "@embed": "@link" }  // IRI only
  },
  "task:relatedHistory": {
    "@embed": "@link"              // History as pointers
  }
}
```

**Five-level progressive disclosure**:

| Level | Content | Tokens | User |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| **L1** | MOC index scan (name + count) | ~200 | SA initial analysis |
| **L2** | Skill 5W2H summary (what/why/when) | ~500 | SA skill matching |
| **L3** | Link relationships (prerequisites) | ~800 | SA/PA chain discovery |
| **L4** | Schema + steps list | ~1500 | DA tool invocation |
| **L5** | Full content (code + validation) | On-demand | DA execution / CA audit |

This ensures each agent sees **exactly what it needs, nothing more**.

### 3.8 Simplified JSON-LD Usage: Bridging LLM and Knowledge Graph

**The Challenge**: LLMs are not proficient at generating complex JSON-LD structures. They excel at producing natural language and simple JSON objects.

**Our Solution**: A hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both paradigms:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "LLM Output (Simple JSON)"
        LLM_OUT["{<br/>  'think': 'Planning...',<br/>  'content': 'CREATE TABLE...',<br/>  'summary': 'Schema designed'<br/>}"]
    end
    
    subgraph "L2 Blackboard Processing"
        L2B["AgentRunner / L2 Blackboard<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>1. Validate against JSON Schema<br/>2. Convert to JSON-LD node<br/>3. Assign @id<br/>4. Write to L2 blackboard"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Storage Layers"
        L2_MEM["L2 Oxigraph Memory<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>In-memory RDF<br/>Fast queries ~2ms"]
        L0_STORE["L0 Persistent Store<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>redb KV + HyperspaceEngine<br/>Unlimited capacity"]
    end
    
    LLM_OUT --> HARNESS
    HARNESS --> L2_MEM
    L2_MEM -->|Batch write-back| L0_STORE
```

**LLM Response Structure** (Optimized for Multi-Turn Conversations):

```json
{
  "think": "Analyzing user request for database schema design...",
  "content": "CREATE TABLE users (id UUID PRIMARY KEY, email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL);",
  "summary": "Database schema for user table with UUID primary key and unique email constraint"
}
```

**Why This Three-Field Structure?**

| Field | Purpose | Token Efficiency |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **think** | Chain-of-thought reasoning (discarded after turn) | Temporary, not archived |
| **content** | Full detailed output (archived to L0 for traceability) | Complete fidelity |
| **summary** | Concise abstract (kept in L1 context window) | ~90% token savings vs full content |

**Multi-Turn Conversation Optimization**:

```
Turn 1: User asks for schema design
  → LLM produces think/content/summary
  → summary appended to L1 context (~50 tokens)
  → content archived to L0 with @id: "memory:session-001/block-042"

Turn 2: User asks "What tables did we create?"
  → L1 context contains summary: "Database schema for user table..."
  → If details needed, Harness resolves IRI "memory:session-001/block-042" from L0
  → Result: L1 stays small, no information loss
```

**AgentRunner & L2 Blackboard Role**:

The AgentRunner (via L2 Blackboard) acts as the **translation layer** between:
- **LLM's comfort zone**: Simple JSON with think/content/summary
- **System's requirements**: JSON-LD with @id, @type, @context for interoperability

Processing pipeline:
```rust
// Pseudo-code illustrating the transformation
let llm_output = llm_client.generate(prompt).await?; // Returns simple JSON

// Step 1: Validate against JSON Schema
validation_engine.validate(&llm_output.content, &skill.input_schema)?;

// Step 2: Convert to JSON-LD node
let jsonld_node = json!({
    "@id": format!("memory:{}/block-{}", session_id, block_counter),
    "@type": ["mem:MemoryBlock", "exec:TaskResult"],
    "mem:content": llm_output.content,
    "mem:summary": llm_output.summary,
    "mem:embedding": embedding_service.index(&llm_output.content).await?
});

// Step 3: Write to L2 blackboard (Oxigraph in-memory)
l2_manager.insert_node(&jsonld_node)?;

// Step 4: Schedule batch write-back to L0
scheduler.schedule_writeback(session_id, block_counter);
```

This design achieves:
- ✅ **Performance**: L2 in-memory queries at ~2ms latency
- ✅ **Scalability**: L0 disk-backed storage with unlimited capacity
- ✅ **Token Economy**: Summary-based L1 context keeps token usage minimal
- ✅ **Traceability**: Full content preserved in L0 with IRI references
- ✅ **Interoperability**: JSON-LD enables cross-agent data sharing

## 4. 5W2H Task Ontology: Structured Intent Modeling

### 4.1 Why 5W2H: The Universal Task Ontology

**The Foundation of All Structured Thinking**

Wild AgentOS is built on **two universal frameworks** that are essential for handling any task:

1. **5W2H (What, Why, Who, When, Where, How, How Much)** - The **Task Ontology**
   - Answers: "What exactly needs to be done?"
   - Purpose: Clarifies intent, constraints, and success criteria
   - Timing: Applied at **task initialization** phase

2. **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)** - The **Execution Model**
   - Answers: "How do we systematically execute and improve?"
   - Purpose: Provides iterative execution with continuous feedback
   - Timing: Applied throughout **task lifecycle**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Universal Frameworks (Always Required)"
        U1["5W2H<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Task Ontology<br/>Clarifies WHAT to do"]
        U2["PDCA Cycle<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Execution Model<br/>Defines HOW to execute"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Specialized Models (Skill Extensions)"
        S1["SWOT Analysis<br/>Strategic positioning"]
        S2["5 Whys<br/>Root cause analysis"]
        S3["SMART Goals<br/>Goal refinement"]
        S4["Kanban<br/>Workflow visualization"]
    end
    
    U1 -->|Foundation| TASK[Executable Task]
    U2 -->|Process| TASK
    S1 -.->|Optional Skill| TASK
    S2 -.->|Optional Skill| TASK
    S3 -.->|Optional Skill| TASK
    S4 -.->|Optional Skill| TASK
    
    style U1 fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:3px
    style U2 fill:#e8f5e9,stroke:#2e7d32,stroke-width:3px
    style S1 fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style S2 fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style S3 fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
    style S4 fill:#fff3e0,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

**Why Both Are Irreplaceable:**

```
Any Executable Task = 5W2H (Intent Clarity) + PDCA (Systematic Execution)
```

| Framework | Role | Without It... |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| **5W2H** | Defines **WHAT** needs to be done | Ambiguous goals → misaligned expectations |
| **PDCA** | Defines **HOW** to execute iteratively | Chaotic implementation → no quality control |

**The Complete Workflow:**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SA as SupervisorAgent
    participant PA as PlanAgent
    participant DA as DoAgent
    participant CA as CheckAgent
    participant AA as ActAgent
    
    User->>SA: Submit task request
    Note over SA: Step 1: Extract 5W2H<br/>(What/Why/Who/When/Where/How/HowMuch)
    
    SA->>PA: Execute PLAN phase
    PA->>PA: Generate micro-flow DAG
    PA-->>SA: Return execution plan
    
    SA->>DA: Execute DO phase
    DA->>DA: Call tools, write artifacts
    DA-->>SA: Return implementation
    
    SA->>CA: Execute CHECK phase
    CA->>CA: Audit by 5W2H dimensions
    CA-->>SA: Return audit verdict
    
    SA->>AA: Execute ACT phase
    AA->>AA: Decide: Pass/Rollback/Terminate
    AA-->>SA: Final decision
    
    SA-->>User: Deliver result + archive
```

### 4.2 Beyond Free-Text Prompts

Traditional agents accept unstructured prompts, leading to ambiguous goals and unauditable execution. Wild AgentOS introduces **5W2H task ontology** as the standardized metadata framework for all non-trivial tasks.

```mermaid
graph TB
    WHAT["What: Core objective<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Required at creation"] --> WHY
    WHY["Why: Intent & success criteria<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Required at creation<br/>Sub: priority, criteria"] --> WHO
    WHY --> WHEN
    WHAT --> HOW
    HOW["How: Methods & steps<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Filled by PA<br/>Sub: planIRI, skills, dependencies"] --> WHERE
    HOW --> HOWMUCH
    WHO["Who: Stakeholders & roles<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Filled by SA/PA<br/>Sub: requestor, assignees, requiredRole"] --> HOWMUCH
    WHEN["When: Time constraints<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Filled by user/SA/PA<br/>Sub: deadline, duration, timezone"] --> HOWMUCH
    WHERE["Where: Data sources & environment<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Filled by PA/DA<br/>Sub: repos, branches, env"] --> HOWMUCH
    HOWMUCH["How Much: Resource budget<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Filled by SA/PA/CA<br/>Sub: tokenBudget, maxCycles, quality"]
    
    HOWMUCH -.-> CA_AUDIT[CA audit basis]
    WHEN -.-> CA_AUDIT
    WHAT -.-> CA_AUDIT
    WHY -.-> CA_AUDIT
```

### 4.3 Progressive Filling Lifecycle

Each dimension has a `fillStage` attribute marking when it should be populated:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    CREATE: Task Creation
    PLAN: PA Planning
    DO: DA Execution
    CHECK: CA Audit
    ACT: AA Decision
    DONE: Archive to L0
    
    CREATE --> PLAN: SA scheduling
    PLAN --> DO: PA outputs plan
    DO --> CHECK: DA completes
    CHECK --> ACT: CA outputs audit
    ACT --> PLAN: Rollback replan
    ACT --> DONE: Pass
    
    note right of CREATE: Fill What / Why / partial Who & When
    note right of PLAN: Fill How / Where / complete When & Who
    note right of DO: Fill Where details / preliminary HowMuch
    note right of CHECK: Fill HowMuch actual values / verify all dimensions
    note right of DONE: Freeze full 5W2H archive to L0
```

**Example lifecycle**:

```json
// Stage 1: Creation (SA extracts minimal set)
{
  "@id": "task:sales-q2-analysis",
  "task:5W2H": {
    "what": "Analyze Q2 regional sales data and generate forecast report",
    "why": {
      "description": "Provide basis for inventory planning",
      "successCriteria": ["Output visualization with regional growth comparison and forecast"],
      "priority": "high"
    },
    "who": { "requestor": "user:vp-sales", "requiredRole": "agent:Do" },
    "when": { "deadline": "2026-05-20T18:00:00+08:00" }
  }
}

// Stage 2: Planning (PA completes How/Where)
{
  "task:5W2H": {
    "where": {
      "dataSources": ["file://data/sales_q2.csv", "db://crm/deals"],
      "executionEnvironment": "sandbox"
    },
    "how": {
      "planIRI": "plan:task-tree/sales-q2",
      "preferredSkills": ["skill:python-analysis", "skill:forecasting"],
      "requiredSteps": "1. Data cleaning → 2. Regional grouping → 3. Forecast modeling → 4. Report generation"
    }
  }
}

// Stage 3: Audit (CA fills actual HowMuch)
{
  "task:5W2H": {
    "howMuch": {
      "tokenBudget": 5000,
      "actualCost": 5600,
      "maxPDCACycles": 3,
      "actualCycles": 2
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.4 Dimension-Level Structured Audit

CA doesn't just say "PASS/FAIL". It audits **each 5W2H dimension independently**:

```json
{
  "auditBy5W2H": {
    "what": { "verdict": "PASS", "evidence": "Report generated with regional comparison and forecast" },
    "why": { "verdict": "PASS", "evidence": "Conclusions directly usable for inventory planning" },
    "when": { "verdict": "PASS", "evidence": "Delivered at 5/19 14:00, before deadline" },
    "where": { "verdict": "PASS", "evidence": "Data sources matched, sandbox environment secure" },
    "how": { "verdict": "PASS", "evidence": "All four steps completed as planned" },
    "howMuch": { "verdict": "WARNING", "evidence": "Token exceeded by 12%, but result quality high" }
  },
  "overallVerdict": "CONDITIONAL_PASS"
}
```

AA then makes dimension-aware decisions:
- What/Why FAIL → Rollback to SA for re-analysis
- How/Where FAIL → Rollback to PA for plan correction
- When/HowMuch FAIL → If justified, pass; otherwise degrade or terminate

### 4.5 Pattern Recognition: 5W2H-Driven Experience Reuse

L0 stores all completed tasks as frozen `task:CompletedTaskSnapshot`. SA's pattern recognition organ queries for similar experiences:

```sparql
PREFIX task: <https://wildagentos.org/ontology/task#>

SELECT ?pastTask ?whySimilarity ?howSimilarity
WHERE {
  GRAPH system:experience {
    ?pastTask a task:CompletedTaskSnapshot .
    ?pastTask task:5W2H/task:why ?pastWhy .
    ?pastTask task:5W2H/task:how/task:planIRI ?pastPlan .
    BIND(external:cosineSimilarity(?currentWhyVec, ?pastWhyVec) AS ?whySimilarity)
  }
  FILTER(?whySimilarity > 0.85)
}
ORDER BY DESC(?whySimilarity)
LIMIT 5
```

Matched historical 5W2H subgraphs are injected into SA decision context:
- Recommend same `task:how/preferredSkills`
- Warn about historical `task:where` pitfalls (e.g., unstable branch)
- Provide historical `task:howMuch/actualCost` as budget reference

## 5. Skill Graph: Cognitive Knowledge Network with Automatic Evolution

### 5.1 Beyond Static Skill Libraries

Traditional agent frameworks treat skills as static function libraries. Wild AgentOS implements a **dynamic cognitive knowledge network** where skills evolve through usage, gain experience fragments, and self-organize via semantic links.

```mermaid
graph TB
    BASE["skill:Skill<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Base class with 5W2H metadata<br/>+ Schema + Signature"]

    BASE --> ATOMIC["skill:AtomicSkill<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Indivisible atomic skill<br/>With clear entrypoint"]
    BASE --> COMPOSITE["skill:CompositeSkill<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Composite skill<br/>Links to sub-skills"]
    BASE --> MOC["skill:MOC<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Map of Content navigation node<br/>Pure navigation, no entrypoint"]
    BASE --> FRAGMENT["skill:KnowledgeFragment<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>Experience knowledge fragment<br/>Attached to specific Skill"]
    BASE --> MCP_WRAPPER["skill:MCPTool<br/>━━━━━━━━<br/>MCP tool wrapper<br/>Bridges external MCP ecosystem"]

    style BASE fill:#e3f2fd
    style ATOMIC fill:#e8f5e9
    style COMPOSITE fill:#fff3e0
    style MOC fill:#f3e5f5
    style FRAGMENT fill:#ffebee
    style MCP_WRAPPER fill:#e0f2f1
```

### 5.2 Six Semantic Link Types

Skills connect via six relationship types, each triggering different SA reasoning behaviors:

| Link Type | SA Reasoning Behavior | Example |
|-----------|----------------------|---------|
| `PrerequisiteLink` | Auto-include Skill B when selecting A | JWT auth → auto-load Rust basics |
| `CompositionLink` | Recursively expand sub-skills / MOC navigation | MOC auth domain → expand JWT/OAuth2/Token |
| `RelatedLink` | Recommend B after completing A | Complete JWT implementation → suggest middleware integration |
| `AlternativeLink` | Auto-switch to B if A unavailable | Rust env unavailable → switch to Node.js version |
| `ExtendsLink` | Choose A for basic, B for advanced | Basic JWT → OAuth2 full authorization |
| `GeneralizationLink` | Map specific tasks to general templates | Sales forecast → time series forecasting |

**SPARQL property path recursion** discovers dependency chains up to 3 levels deep:

```sparql
?target (skill:links/skill:target){0,3} ?chainNode .
```

### 5.3 Automatic Evolution Driven by AA

After each task completion, AA analyzes execution trajectory and evolves the Skill Graph:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    TASK_DONE[Task Completed] --> AA_ANALYZE[AA Analyzes Execution Trace]

    AA_ANALYZE --> NEW_FAIL{New<br/>Failure Mode?}
    NEW_FAIL -->|Yes| WRITE_FRAG[Create KnowledgeFragment<br/>Attach to corresponding Skill]

    AA_ANALYZE --> NEW_LINK{New<br/>Skill Association?}
    NEW_LINK -->|Yes| WRITE_LINK[Create RelatedLink<br/>Connect two skills]

    AA_ANALYZE --> MATURITY{Maturity<br/>Needs Adjustment?}
    MATURITY -->|Yes| UPDATE_MAT[Update skill:maturity]

    AA_ANALYZE --> STATS{Update Statistics}
    STATS --> UPDATE_STATS[Update graphMeta:<br/>usageCount / successRate]

    WRITE_FRAG --> UPDATE_STATS
    WRITE_LINK --> UPDATE_STATS
    UPDATE_MAT --> UPDATE_STATS
    UPDATE_STATS --> DONE[Archive to L0]
```

**Example**: CA discovers that JWT key rotation causes mass user logout. AA creates a KnowledgeFragment:

```json
{
  "@id": "skill:fragment/jwt-key-rotation-pitfall",
  "@type": "skill:KnowledgeFragment",
  "schema:name": "JWT Key Rotation Pitfall",
  "skill:attachedTo": "skill:rust-jwt-auth",
  "skill:content": {
    "problem": "Directly replacing old key during rotation invalidates all issued tokens",
    "recommendation": "Use JWKS endpoint to publish multiple public keys simultaneously for graceful transition",
    "alternativeSkill": "skill:jwks-implementation"
  }
}
```

Future SA executions encountering JWT tasks will see this fragment and recommend JWKS approach.

### 5.4 Self-Bootstrapping: /learn and /reduce Mechanisms

When DA encounters a problem with no available skill:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DA
    participant SA
    participant L0
    participant Harness

    DA->>Harness: Report: No skill available for current problem
    Harness->>SA: Notify: New skill needed

    rect rgb(230,240,255)
        Note over SA: /learn Phase
        SA->>SA: Analyze problem characteristics
        SA->>SA: Generate 5W2H draft
        SA->>L0: Create Skill node (status: draft)
        SA->>L0: Establish link to relevant MOC
    end

    DA->>DA: Continue solving (without skill guidance)
    DA->>Harness: Return solution
    Harness->>L0: Record to temporary experience node

    rect rgb(255,240,230)
        Note over SA: /reduce Phase
        SA->>L0: Extract solution
        SA->>L0: Populate Skill content/steps
        SA->>L0: Update status: active
        SA->>L0: Compute Ed25519 signature
    end

    SA-->>DA: New skill ready
```

This enables **autonomous skill acquisition** without human intervention.

### 5.5 Advanced Skill Graph Features

The Skill Graph has evolved beyond the six link types and automatic evolution described above, adding four advanced subsystems:

**Hypergraph Composition** (`src/skill_graph/types.rs`): First-class `Hyperedge` type with `CompositionType` enum supporting Sequential, Parallel, Conditional, Optional, and Fallback compositions — enabling complex multi-skill workflows as first-class graph nodes.

**Poincaré Structural Embeddings** (`src/skill_graph/embedding.rs`): Computes geometric embeddings from graph topology (prerequisite depth + tag fingerprinting), enabling Poincaré ball-based similarity search and structural clustering of skills.

**Graph Algorithms** (`src/skill_graph/graph_algorithms.rs`): PageRank for skill importance ranking, betweenness centrality for bottleneck detection, label-propagation community detection for automatic skill clustering, DFS prerequisite chain discovery, and Tarjan SCC for cycle detection in the skill dependency graph.

**Formal Invariant Verification** (`src/skill_graph/verification.rs`): Six invariant checks enforcing graph integrity — acyclicity (no circular dependencies), link existence (no dangling references), composite reachability (all sub-skills accessible), no deprecated prerequisites, valid 5W2H metadata, and valid security levels. Violations are flagged before graph mutations are committed.

**Temporal Versioning**: Snapshot and rollback support, allowing the Skill Graph to be checkpointed before mutations and reverted if verification fails.

**Oxigraph SPARQL Bridge**: Real-time bidirectional sync between `SkillGraphStore` and the unified Oxigraph RDF store via SPARQL INSERT/DELETE operations and named graph isolation (`system:skills`).

## 6. Proactive Perception Engine: Anomaly Detection & Intelligent Intervention

### 6.1 Ten Perception Triggers

The ProactiveEngine monitors execution through ten distinct triggers, each mapped to specific intervention plans:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "10 Perception Triggers"
        T1["TaskStart: Complexity analysis"]
        T2["PlanCompleted: Subtask limit check"]
        T3["ProgressAnomaly: Deduplication window"]
        T4["CheckCompleted: Verdict-based alerts"]
        T5["TaskEnd: Experience extraction"]
        T6["CycleTimeout: Elapsed time monitoring"]
        T7["AgentBlocked: Health detection"]
        T8["ResourceConflict: Queue/delay analysis"]
        T9["QualityDegradation: Rollback signals"]
        T10["UserFeedback: Feedback log"]
    end
    
    subgraph "Intervention Plans"
        A1["Reassess current plan"]
        A2["Restart blocked agent"]
        A3["Adjust resource allocation"]
        A4["Notify human supervisor"]
    end
    
    T1 & T2 & T3 & T4 & T5 & T6 & T7 & T8 & T9 & T10 -->|"Detect Anomaly"| A1 & A2 & A3 & A4
```

### 6.2 Anomaly Deduplication

Time-window based filtering prevents alert storms:

```yaml
perception:
  anomaly_dedup_window_seconds: 60  # Suppress duplicate alerts within 60s
  simple_input_threshold: 50         # Input < 50 chars → simple task
  medium_input_threshold: 200        # Input < 200 chars → medium complexity
  cycle_timeout_secs: 300            # Alert if cycle exceeds 5 minutes
  max_iterations_before_alert: 10    # Alert after 10 iterations without progress
  error_rate_threshold: 0.5          # Alert if > 50% tool calls fail
```

### 6.3 5W2H Constraint Checking

ProactiveEngine validates execution against 5W2H constraints:

- **Deadline violation**: Current time > `task:when/deadline` → escalate to human
- **Budget overrun**: Token consumption > `task:howMuch/tokenBudget × 0.8` → warn SA
- **Role mismatch**: Assigned agent role ≠ `task:who/requiredRole` → reassign
- **Environment conflict**: Two tasks modifying same repo/branch → serialize execution

---

## 7. Advanced Tool Execution Framework

### 7.1 Built-in Tools (20+) with Micro-Tool System

| Category | Tools | Innovation |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| **File Operations** | `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_edit`, `file_list`, `glob_search`, `grep_search` | Symlink detection, path traversal prevention |
| **Network** | `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` (DuckDuckGo fallback chain) | TLS enforcement, proxy support |
| **Execution** | `Bash`, `PowerShell` (sandboxed with timeout) | Configurable timeouts, restricted paths |
| **Knowledge Import** | `knowledge_import_json`, `knowledge_import_url`, `knowledge_import_directory` | Auto-graphification to RDF |
| **Knowledge Graph** | `knowledge_extract`, `knowledge_query`, `kg_search`, `kg_neighbors`, `knowledge_extract_code` | SPARQL queries, AST parsing |
| **Skill Management** | `create_skill`, `convert_skill`, `list_skills` | LLM-powered skill generation |
| **Ontology** | `ontology_register`, `knowledge_bridge` | Cross-domain semantic alignment |

**Micro-Tool Innovation**: For large tool results (>8KB), system automatically generates conversational micro-tools:

```rust
// After file_read returns 50KB content
Micro-Tool: "search_in_results" 
Description: "Search within the previously read file content"
Parameters: { "query": "string", "context_lines": "number" }
```

This transforms unwieldy outputs into **interactive queryable artifacts**.

### 7.2 Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

External tool server integration via MCP standard:
- Connect to remote tool providers (GitHub, Slack, Jira, etc.)
- Dynamic tool discovery at runtime
- Secure authentication with API key rotation

---

## 8. Checkpoint & Recovery: Fault-Tolerant Execution

Session state persistence enables recovery from crashes:

```rust
// Create checkpoint at critical points
let checkpoint_id = checkpoint_manager.create(
    &task_iri,
    &format!("cycle:{}", cycle_id),
    &state_json,
    &metadata_json,
    &context_json,
    &artifacts
)?;

// Restore after crash
let restored_state = checkpoint_manager.restore(&task_iri)?;
```

**Use Cases**:
- Long-running task recovery (hours/days)
- Agent restart without losing context
- Debugging and replay for post-mortem analysis

---

## 9. Worker Task Queue: Background Job Processing

Persistent queue for asynchronous operations:

- **Technology**: yaque (Yet Another Queue) + bincode serialization
- **Features**: Disk-backed persistence, acknowledgment, peek operations
- **Use Cases**: 
  - Batch knowledge import (thousands of documents)
  - Scheduled skill evolution (nightly optimization)
  - Periodic cleanup (expired cache entries)
  - Asynchronous embedding generation

---

## 10. Template Engine & JSON Schema Validation

### 10.1 Markdown-Based Prompt Templates

```
## Role: {{agent_role}}
## Task: {{task_description}}

### Context
{{l3_projection}}

### Available Skills
{{skill_list}}

### 5W2H Constraints
- What: {{what}}
- Why: {{why}}
- When: {{deadline}}
- How Much: {{token_budget}}

### Instructions
...
```

**Features**:
- Recursive directory scanning
- Variable interpolation (`{placeholder}` syntax)
- Template inheritance (via includes)
- Version-controlled in Git

### 10.2 One Roundtrip, Double Harvest

Advanced validation mode that extracts both metadata and converts to JSON-LD in a single LLM call:

```
// LLM output
{
  "thought": "Planning database schema...",
  "content": "CREATE TABLE users...",
  "summary": "Database schema designed",
  "metadata": {
    "tables": ["users", "orders"],
    "relationships": ["one-to-many"]
  }
}

// System processes:
// 1. Validate metadata against JSON Schema
// 2. Convert validated metadata to JSON-LD node
// 3. Write to L2 blackboard with @id
// Result: Single LLM call → validated structured data + natural language
```

This doubles information extraction efficiency compared to traditional single-purpose prompts.
